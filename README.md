# MeetingSummarizer
My team and I developed this project as part of our mini project. Our methodology integrates Whisper for automatic speech recognition (ASR), Hugging Face transformer models for text summarization, and Gradio for creating an interactive web interface. The workflow processes audio files, transcribes them into text, and generates concise summaries.
